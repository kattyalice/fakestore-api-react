This project was built as a complete React web application designed to simulate a functional online store using the FakeStoreAPI. I was able to complete my goal to create a multi-page, user-friendly interface where users could browse, view, create, edit, and delete products, while incorporating frameworks such as React Router, React Bootstrap, and React Query.

The application is structured around a series of core pages, each serving a specific purpose. The Home Page serves as the introduction to the store, greeting users with a clean layout and a simple welcome message all in the theme of a fake store. It includes a clearly visible button that navigates to the product listing, setting the tone for a smooth and intuitive user journey. The page is styled using React Bootstrap, ensuring a polished, responsive design that adapts seamlessly across devices.

The Product Listing Page fetches real-time data from the FakeStoreAPI and presents all available products in an organized layout. Each product card displays essential information including an image, title, and price, along with a button that allows users to view more detailed information. Navigation between pages is handled by React Router, allowing for a fluid, single-page-app experience without unnecessary page reloads.

I make sure to have a details button when clicked takes you to the Product Details Page, where detailed information about a selected product is displayed. It includes options to “Add to Cart,” “Delete,” or “Edit” the product. Although the FakeStoreAPI does not permanently alter data, the application is fully capable of sending DELETE and PUT requests, simulating how such actions would behave in a real-world backend environment. 

To further extend functionality, the Add Product Page provides a form that allows users to create new products via a POST request to the FakeStoreAPI. The form collects key product details such as title, price, category, and description, and upon submission, a confirmation message is displayed to show that the product has been successfully “created.” This page demonstrates understanding of controlled components, form validation, and API integration using React Bootstrap’s form elements for a professional look.

The Edit Product Page builds on that functionality by allowing users to update existing products. The form is automatically populated with the product’s current data using the product ID and a GET request. After editing, a PUT request is sent to simulate an update, and the user receives a success message confirming the operation.

For deletion, the application includes a confirmation modal that appears before a product is removed, ensuring that users don’t accidentally delete important data. Once confirmed, the app simulates a deletion through a DELETE request and redirects the user back to the product listing page. While the API itself doesn’t permanently remove data, the app behaves exactly as if it did—providing a realistic frontend experience for testing and learning purposes.

Finally, a React Bootstrap Navigation Bar ties the entire application together. Present on every page, it provides quick access to the Home, Product Listing, and Add Product pages. The navbar is fully responsive, ensuring usability across both desktop and mobile devices.
